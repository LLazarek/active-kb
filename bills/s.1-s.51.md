# S1
## Context
Many efforts to restrict access to voting in states
- Voter ID laws
- Restricted early voting
- Restricted mail voting
- Fewer polling places / drop boxes

The mechanisms and avenues being targeted suspiciously correlate with the those widely attributed for record voter turnour in 2020 (and Democratic victories).
Especially early voting and easily accessible mail voting.

Additionally, gerrymandering is commonplace.
The supreme and lower courts are unwilling or uninterested in challenges to partisan gerrymandering or enforcement of voting rights.
  
## Criticisms
### Mitch McConnell
https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/call-hr-1-what-it-is-the-democrat-politician-protection-act/2019/01/17/dcc957be-19cb-11e9-9ebf-c5fed1b7a081_story.html

This consists primarily of nationalistic, partisan name calling.
Not much real substance.

The only actual concrete claims/criticisms are:
1. The FEC change is bad
2. Election day holiday is bad
3. Mandatory transparency around campaign support, advertising threatens privacy and free speech
4. Publicly funding election campaigns is a bad use of tax money
5. The federal government shouldn't mandate how state elections are run

### The Hill
https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/politics/432914-hr-1-is-for-the-politicians-not-the-people

Supposedly 28 Republic suggestions for HR1 were all rejected.
*What were they?*

Points to the ACLU response.

Also regurgitates criticisms 3 and 5 from Mitch.

### ACLU
https://www.aclu.org/letter/aclu-letter-house-rules-committee-hr-1

The most cogent set of criticisms I've found.

HR1 voting reform act is nearly all good.
The main problem is that it may infringe on free speech rights of citizens and organizations.

Specifically: the wording of what constitutes speech supporting/opposing a candidate's election (and hence subject to regulation) is vague and broad.
Hence, more organizations would be required to disclose donors in order to make political advertisements.
Specifically, ads about an issue that mention a political candidate.
{*Seems good to me?*}
{*In particular, there seems to be a hidden assumption in this letter than organizations like Planned Parenthood or the ACLU _need_ to mention condidates in their messaging/ads about issues.*}
{*I don't buy that. In fact, I suspect we'd all be better off if they didn't!*}

The ACLU claims {*without evidence*} that this would:

1. Risk that donors to "multi-issue" organizations would have their names attached to ads about issues they aren't interested in or support.
   {*My first thought is that "yes, they donated to a multi-issue organization, so if they're not happy about the other things the org does then why not donate to something more specific?"*}

2. Be too expensive for small organizations to comply with.

3. Cause organizations to self-censor: not make any ads for fear of having to disclose donors.
   {*Wondering: couldn't this just as well instead have the effect of splitting organizations into two kinds: action and public messaging?*}
   {*Thus people who want ot remain anon can donate to the action branch instead of messaging, and there's just no way to support messaging privately.*}
   {*This seems like a totally reasonable model to get the best of both worlds of transparency around advertising, while still allowing anon issue advocacy donations.*}
