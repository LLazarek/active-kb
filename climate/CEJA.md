Criticism of CEJA
-----------------
[News article with some criticism](https://www.pantagraph.com/news/state-and-regional/clean-energy-jobs-act-advances-to-illinois-house-floor/article_3694634e-2d61-59f9-a3bc-533bdfb32d4a.html):
> carbon fees will cause fossil fuel power plants to close or rates to go up -- IL Energy Assoc.
> CEJA would increase southern IL electricity bills by $19.2bn over 30y, i.e. $24 more per house per month on avg -- Ameren IL

[Competing bill: Downstate Clean Energy Affordability Act](https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/billstatus.asp?DocNum=1734&GAID=16&GA=102&DocTypeID=HB&LegID=130416&SessionID=110)
- Supported primarily by [Amaren IL](https://www.ameren.com/illinois/): an energy company
- Backed by southern IL lawmakers (CEJA primarily backed by northern and central IL lawmakers)


FEJA
----
FEJA is the predecessor bill to CEJA, supported by mostly the same organizations it seems.

[FEJA partially subsidized ComEd and was probably influenced by its corrupt practices](https://www.wbez.org/stories/the-true-high-cost-were-all-paying-for-comeds-springfield-corruption/000f0b8b-3183-4d7b-b5fc-bee3f2c4d99e)
- The main part of the bill beneficial to ComEd was subsidization of 2 ComEd nuclear power plants, and consumer rate increases to support them
- But, [this 2019 analysis](https://www.remi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/872-The-Impacts-of-Illinois-Nuclear-Power-Plants-on-the-Economy-and-the-Environment.pdf) claims that not supporting those power plants would likely have lead to higher rates and fewer jobs in IL because that power would be bought from out-of-state
  - and that out-of-state power would likely have been from fossil-fuels
